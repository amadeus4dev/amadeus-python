Add support for the `Flight Create Orders <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-create-orders>`_

The Flight Create Order API is a flight booking API that lets you perform the final booking for a desired flight and ancillary products (additional bags, extra legroom, etc.). The API returns a unique ID for the flight order and reservation details. This API is used to perform the final booking on confirmed fares returned by the Flight Offers Price API.

Add support for the `Flight Offers Price <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-price>`_

The Flight Offers Price API confirms the flight price (including taxes and fees) and availability for a given flight returned by the Flight Offers Search API. The API also returns pricing for ancillary products (additional bags, extra legroom, etc.) and the payment information details needed for booking.

Add support for the `Flight Offers Search <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-offers-search>`_

The API returns airline name, price and fare details, as well as additional information like baggage allowance, prices for additional baggage and departure terminal.

Add support for the `Trip Parser <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/trip-parser>`_

The Trip Parser API parses information from various booking confirmation emails and returns a standardized, structured travel itinerary. The API can extract relevant information from a wide variety of flight, hotel, rental car and rail providersâ€™ confirmation emails by first identifying the provider and then using a database of provider-specific email structures to determine which information to extract. The API then returns a link to the JSON structure of the itinerary.

Add self-containing executable examples for the existing supported endpoints.

The link to download the AI-generated picture is valid for 24 hours. This API is an experimental project created by the Amadeus AI Lab using the Nvidia StyleGAN framework. This API is free to use and we welcome any feedback you may have about improvements.

Add support for the `Flight Delay Prediction <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/flight-delay-prediction>`_

The Flight Delay Prediction API returns the probability that a given flight will be delayed by four possible delay lengths: less than 30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 60-120 minutes and over 120 minutes/cancellation. The API receives flight information and applies a machine-learning model trained with Amadeus historical data to determine the probability of flight delay.

Release of the `Airport On-Time Performance <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/air/api-doc/airport-on-time-performance>`_

The Airport On-Time Performance API returns the estimated percentage of on-time flight departures for a given airport and date. The API receives the 3-letter IATA airport code and departure date and applies a machine-learning model trained with Amadeus historical data to estimate the overall airport on-time performance. This API is in currently in beta and only returns accurate data for airports located in the U.S.

3.2.0 - 2019-11-07
--------------------
Add support for the `Trip Purpose Prediction API <https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/trip/api-doc/trip-purpose-prediction>`_

The Trip Purpose Prediction API returns the probability of whether a round-trip flight itinerary is for business or leisure travel.

The location can be defined as area bound by four coordinates or as a geographical coordinate with a radius. The popularity of a place or 'point of interest' is determined by AVUXI's proprietary algorithm that considers factors such as ratings, check-ins, category scores among other factors from a host of online media sources.
